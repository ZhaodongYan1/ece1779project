All lecture and tutorial examples require the following in order to work:
    - Python 3.6
    - A python virtual environment
    - Flask
    - zappa
    - boto3
    - AWS CLI 

Perform these steps to run the examples:

1) Install python 3.6 by following the instructions for your respective platform available at https://www.python.org/

2) Download and unpack the example sources:

   a) Download the example sources,
   b) Open a shell and navigate to the location of the tar.gz file
   c) Uncompress and untar (e.g., tar -xzf solution.tar.gz)
   d) Go into the example directory (e.g., cd solution)

3) Create a new python virtual environment as follows:

   python -m venv venv

   For some platforms substitute python for python3 or python3.6

4) Activate the virtual environment

   source venv/bin/activate

5) Install Flask

   pip install flask

6) Install AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)

   Follow instruction in https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

7) Install boto3

   pip install boto3

8) Install zappa

   pip install zappa

9) Before you can begin using zappa, you should set up authentication
credentials. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the IAM
Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#. You can create
or use an existing user. Go to manage access keys and generate a new
set of keys.  You will need both the aws_access_key_id and
aws_secret_access_key.

10) Configure your credentials

   aws configure

11) Edit the file zappa_settings.json.  Set the value of the key "s3_bucket" to
   the name of one of your existing S3 buckets.

12) Deploy the example on AWS Lambda

   zappa deploy dev
